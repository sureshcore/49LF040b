You will need:
	msp430-gcc
	msp430flasher in your PATH
	and obviusly msp430 hardware.

I used msp430G2553, which came with my 1.4v launchpad.
So yaeh. Also you will probably need to know how to C 
in order to fix my shit-tier code.

And public domain. Because who cares.

Oh and by the way, this shit does not work yet. It is 
not even done yet, in fact.
If it ever gets done I will say so here. But I doubt 
it will ever get to work.
